Welcome to the Expense Tracking System! This project is designed to help users manage their personal finances by tracking expenses and income. While this system is currently in its development phase, it aims to provide a user-friendly interface and robust functionality for efficient financial management.


Current Status
This project is currently in its early development stage. The core functionalities have been implemented, but several features are still under construction. Users can track expenses and income, but additional functionalities like advanced reporting and user profile management are yet to be completed.

Future Enhancements
We plan to implement the following features in upcoming releases:
Savings Management: Allow users to set aside savings amounts directly within the application.
Instant Withdrawals: Enable users to make instant withdrawals from their savings for greater financial flexibility.
Enhanced reporting capabilities (graphs, pie charts).
User profile management (profile updates, password resets).
Mobile responsiveness for better usability on various devices.
Integration with third-party financial services (e.g., bank APIs).
